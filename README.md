# ETCH-A-SKETCH
JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL ETCH-A-SKETCH GAME MADE FOR DRAWING PURPOSE, THIS WAS A TASK CARRIED OUT FROM ODIN PROJECT...I NOTICED IT WAS TO HELP US GET FAMILIAR WITH DOM MANIPULTION BSICALLY; WAS KINDA FUN AND TO BE HONEST ONE OF MY FASTEST WORKS FOR NOW
I MADE A FEATURE WHERE YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO DRAW UNTIL YOU PICK A REASONABLE GRID VALUE, YOU ALSO HAVE THE CHOICE OF SELECTING YOUR COLOR AND ALS0 A RAINBOW COLOR.
IT ASLO HAS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF DRAWING AT YOUR DESITRED LOCATION IN THE SENSE THAT YOU CLICK ON THE BODY TO DRAW THEN YOU CAN BEGIN TO MOUSEOVER, THEN CLICK WHEREVER YOU'VE DRAWN TO STOP DRAWING.
